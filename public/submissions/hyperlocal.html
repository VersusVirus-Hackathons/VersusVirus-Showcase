                <p>Loca.Ly : Know your neighborhood. 
Whether it’s support for shopping for particularly vulnerable persons during COVID-19 lockdown, a lost cat, searching for a helping hand in the household: There is much that happens right around us, in the close vicinity of our neighborhood. 
But how to reach out, and how to get to know about it? In particular during a lockdown situation, but also in the new normal.


People need fast accurate local knowledge about nearby resources.
We designed local.ly as a mobile-first solution based on a proximity approach.  
local.ly aims to reactivate local small business and connecting them to their neighborhood.
This solution will also promote local information, municipality announcements, events, support, knowledge and service sharing between neighbors.
