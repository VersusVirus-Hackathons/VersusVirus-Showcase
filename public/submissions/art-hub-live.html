        <p>We have leveraged existing off the shelf software available combining customized WIX solution for website and ticketing with a variety of streaming solutions leveraging OBS and WMix.
Our current website allows artists and individuals to register and create their own profile. It also offers the possibility to view upcoming events and buy tickets. We are currently testing different streaming options; our preferred method for the moment is direct streaming on a private page of the Art Hub website followed by an interactive section on Zoom with the artist and audience. During this beta phase performances are completely free but participants are given the performerâ€™s Paypal account so that they are able to make a voluntary donation.</p>
        <p>There is a high level of back-end support required to prepare the artists for a flawless high quality streaming, which is very time consuming and limits the current scalability of the project.</p>
        <p>In a short time period we have hosted two Swiss Artists on our platform performing during the Hackathon weekend: Eoghan O'Sullivan, singer/musician living by Leman Lake, dedicating "Gigs" song to the Versus Virus Hackathon, and Marc Brondex, visual artist living in Rolle performing live drawing show. This proved the relevance of our MVP in the Swiss Context and gives us confidence that this can expand further.</p>
        <p>Participation in the Swiss Versus Virus Hackathon has been an incredible networking opportunity and an amplifier for our project as we've received great feedback from mentors to refine our Sustainability strategy as well as being approached by Swiss potential partners to further nurture our project.</p>
        <p>Now that the prototype and proof of concept validity is confirmed in both Italy and Switzerland we want to move to a crowdfunding phase to fund the technical automation enhancements to enable scalability as well as marketing needed to accelerate the creation of content (artists) as well as user and community acceptance.</p>
