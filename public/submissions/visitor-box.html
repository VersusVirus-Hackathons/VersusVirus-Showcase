    <h1>Visitor Box For Retirement & Nursing Homes "MEET SAVE"</h1>
    <p>Exchange of emotions through all senses should prevent loneliness and create closeness in a real meeting place. 

The idea of the visitor box is meant to provide more
“closeness” during times of necessary social or physical distancing. Visitor boxes can be placed at entrances, receptions or other strategic meeting points of a nursing home and with that provide safe social exchange. Visitors can then register online or by
telephone to come see their loved ones with the precautions to keep them safe.</p>
