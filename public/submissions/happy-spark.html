        <p>Proto.io and bubble.io for the App prototype</p>
        <p>Tackling the idea of happiness, which has such a broad meaning for each individual, was the first challenge. To this we can add the challenge of bringing to work together team-members with such different backgrounds and personal interests, in such a short amount of time. </p>
        <p>In two days, we came from vague ideas to clearly stating a solution to one of the problems that unfolded during the COVID-19 Lockdown. HappySpark has the potential to boost the optimism and wellbeing of individuals and in the same time to reconnect communities, with positive and long-term implications. The App has also a huge potential for development and collaboration with other VV Projects and Apps.</p>
        <p>The whole process from finding ideas to developing them and how to get organized within a new team in 48 hours.</p>
        <p>Develop the concept, a platform and application for HappySpark, work with the Versus Virus incubator and experts and increase brand awareness </p>
