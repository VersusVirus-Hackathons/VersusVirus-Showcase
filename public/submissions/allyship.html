                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Allyship is a project we worked on for #TogetherVsVirus in April. It's an online (and in the future an app) to help healthcare workers find and access trauma-informed individual and/or peer support using an online search tool that will also accept user updates. To help make ongoing change, Allyship will also provide information, programs and resources on trauma-informed workplaces and allyship so more people can work towards supporting healthcare workers and creating psychologically safe healthcare workplaces.

This weekend 3 of our team (now up to 10) were focussed on clarifying our vision, mission and strategic planning.</p>
                <h3>Technologies used</h3>
                <p>This weekend we learned about the Continuous Improvement ideas through LeanStack and created a Lean Canvas. We continued documentation in Google Docs and I created a sandbox website to help us see how our information has changed in WordPress. I used Canva to 'pretty up' our Vision and Mission statement to share with our group.</p>
                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>I'm proud of us getting some clarity and specifics around our vision and mission. We are using 2 big ideas: Allyship and Trauma-Informed Care. These things are compatible, but we needed to do some real thinking about how we are using and presenting them so that the website makes sense to new users.

Andrea’s ‘Aha Moment’ was realizing ‘How this project is more important as we pluck along .Realization of working on something currently non existing that has a potential to change healthcare culture, attend to health cate workers needs and wellbeing ....translating to saving lives, wellbeing of organizations, employees ,patients , families and communities here and around the world .”
</p>
                <h3>Obstacles</h3>
                <p>We have been trying to get our group into a regular meeting time and now that the initial #TogetherVsVirus hackathon is over it's been difficult - as we are up to 10 people now in 4 time zones ranging from Canada's West Coast (GMT-8) to Switzerland (GMT+2). This is one reason we've been struggling to get some clarity.
</p>
                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                <p>I'm very glad to have been introduced to the LeanStack website and tools. We've used Business Model Canvas and it's helpful to have a similar framework with a few key differences. Filling in the Lean Canvas really helped shift some ideas for me.
</p>
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <p>We were able to take our information organizing to create a few things that will help us move forward:
* We have a clear path for creating basic content on the website, so we can start to have group members begin on that.
* We have more direction to better organize ourselves on the website and redo our UX.
I hope we have enough information to help our developer get started</p>
