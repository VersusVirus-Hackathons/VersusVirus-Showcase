        <p>Slack, Coda.io, Zoom, Google Maps, React, Svelte.js, Tailwind, Javascript, Pzthon, Kubernetes, Postgres, Digital Ocean, Pulumi</p>
        <p>Unification of datasets between the various research centers to allow for the merging and focus of efforts.
Web site development with Google Maps and React and Svelte.js and many nice technologies. Lucky to have a developer from New York on the team (Amrit)!
</p>
        <p>The website is already functional and serves as a working MVP.
We have grown the team and attracted interest from other teams and mentors of Versus Virus</p>
        <p>We have learned the power of open collaboration with people from different backgrounds. 

Thought has gone into the means of creating a standardized data entry content that encompasses the relevant fields and criteria required to achieve such a centralized data-set.</p>
        <p>We have prepared a roadmap to complete the development of the site and expand to more clinical trial registries
