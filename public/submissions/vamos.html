        <p>- bluetooth low energy (ble)
- raspberry Pi
- mathematical triangulation
- signal hashing (for privacy)
- server-client architecture
- python, javascript, golang, tcp/ip, redis/mongodb (databases)
- ios/android (for apps)
</p>
        <p>- Understanding and setting into place a bluetooth low energy architecture that can be used for real-time triangulation.
- Defining a strategy that balances both the covid-19 response (non-profit) and sustainable aspects (for-profit). Which companies/incubators should we collaborate with and when.
- Finding the right people to complement a team with good internal people dynamics.
</p>
        <p>- Having Prof. Dr. G. Keith Still on the advisory board and the quality of the entire advisory board (Dr. Federico Botta, lecturer; Marc Lehmann, MSc Insurance; Dr. med. Li Zhang, President; Oliver Hasler Msc, CEO & Partner Investment Company).
- Triangulation measurements with a detection precision of 1 m or better over 30x30 m area (still exploring).
- Detailed server-client system architecture.
- Finding the right people at the right time.
</p>
        <p>Crow-density is a very important topic, which has been studied in depth by
Prof. Dr. G. Keith Still. This topic is not only important for covid-19, but also to elaborate evacuation and safety measures for public places.
In order to detect and triangulate phone signals we had to learn several new techniques (Bluetooth low energy, Raspberry-Pi, in-memory databases, real-time signal processing)
</p>
        <p>- Finish architecture development
- Install web Live Proof-of-Concept Local People Density Detection demos.
- Enlarge the team with new team members (2-3 people ready to join in the next weeks)
- Continue with the VersusVirus Incubator process.
- Secure Funding for Startup Launch.
- Reach out to Key Stakeholders
