        <p>The major challenge was about finding a way to reduce the level of complexity in authentication. At the moment, our solution uses voice biometric authentification. In the market, there exists a lot of digital including several multiple factor verification that includes sending/receiving an SMS or a phone call. It is crucial that the solution works for elderly people to make sure there is a 'safe harbouring'. In this case the lockdown can be much less heavy and economic impact will also be much less.</p>
        <p>We have started contacting the potential partners and so far belocalhero.com has responded our inquiry, and officially agreed to be our partner. In the following weeks, we will be having a meeting with them and discuss about the details of long-term collaboration. We found a team mentor in the person of Ms Regina Roos.</p>
        <p>Existing ‘building blocks’ require deep and intensive research to identify them, contact the persons associated to these 'building blocks', set an appointment and meet virtually by zoom, skype, or teams.

New things can still be reinvented, high tech can be brought back to analog and bring human emotions back to interactions in e-commerce.</p>
